# Tiny Learners App

A fun and interactive learning app for kids under 5, built with React and Capacitor.

## Features
- **Alphabet Learning**: A-Z with voice and examples.
- **Number Learning**: 1-20 with voice and counting stars.
- **Kid-Friendly UI**: Vibrant colors, bouncy animations, and easy navigation.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (installed)
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+ (for Android build)
- Android Studio (for managing the Android project and building the APK)

## Getting Started

1.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run in Browser (Development)**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Building the Android APK

Since this project uses Capacitor, it wraps the web application into a native Android container.

1.  **Build the Web Assets**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2.  **Sync with Android Project**
    ```bash
    npx cap sync
    ```

3.  **Open in Android Studio**
    ```bash
    npx cap open android
    ```
    *Alternatively, open the `android` folder directly in Android Studio.*

4.  **Generate APK**
    -   Inside Android Studio, go to **Build** > **Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)** > **Build APK(s)** for a debug build.
    -   For Google Play Store: Go to **Build** > **Generate Signed Bundle / APK** > **Android App Bundle**.
    -   Follow the wizard to create a keystore and sign your app.

## Project Structure
-   `src/`: React source code.
-   `android/`: Native Android project generated by Capacitor.
-   `dist/`: Built web assets (created after `npm run build`).
